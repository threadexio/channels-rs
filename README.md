## Repos

This library is available in the following languages:

- **[Rust][github-rust]**
- [C][github-c] (work in progress)

Sender/Receiver types to be used with _any_ type that implements [`std::io::Read`] and [`std::io::Write`].

This crate is similar to [`std::sync::mpsc`] in terms of the API, and most of the documentation
for that module carries over to this crate.

Don't think of these channels as a replacement for [`std::sync::mpsc`], but as another implementation that works over many different transports.

These channels are meant to be used in combination with network sockets, local sockets, pipes, etc.

The differences are:

- Channels **will** block, unless the underlying stream is set as non-blocking.
- The amount of messages that can be queued up before reading is dependent on the underlying stream.

# Features

- ðŸš€ Async & Sync API
- ðŸ“¥ Transparent compression
- ðŸ”‘ Transparent authentication with `HMAC-SHA3-512`
- âž• Transparent checksumming with CRC

# cargo features

- `cbor`: Adds support for sending/receiving any type with [`ciborium`].
- `crc`: Adds support for verifying data with CRC checksums.
- `flate2`: Adds support for compressing data with [`flate2`].
- `hmac`: Adds support for cryptographically signing data with [`hmac`] and [`sha3`].
- `json`: Adds support for sending/receiving any typr with [`serde_json`].
- `statistics`: Capture statistic data like: total bytes sent/received, timestamp of last packet, etc
- `tokio`: Adds support for sending/receiving types asynchronously.

## cargo default features

- `serde`: Adds support for sending/receiving any type which implements [`serde::Serialize`] and [`serde::Deserialize`].
- `bincode`: Adds support for sending/receiving any type with [`bincode`].
