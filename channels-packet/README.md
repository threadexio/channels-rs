# channels-packet

This crate contains the logic to parse channels packets. You can read more about those [here](https://github.com/threadexio/channels-rs/blob/master/spec/PROTOCOL.md).

**Note:** The API of this crate is _not_ final and may change at any time without necessarily a major version bump. If you must depend on it pin down the full version of the crate to avoid future incompatibilities.
